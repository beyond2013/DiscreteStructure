# Sets
## Introduction
- Set is the fundamental discrete structure on which all other discrete structures are built.
- Sets are used to group objects together.
- Often, the objects in a set have similar properties.
  + e.g. all students currently enrolled in BSIT 1st semester make up a set.

## Definition
- A set is an unordered collection of objects, called elements or members of the set.  
- A set is said to contain its elements.
- To denote that `a` is an element of set `B`, write $a \in B$
- The notation $a \not\in B$ denotes that `a` is not an element of the set `B`.

## Different ways to Describe a set

- **Roster method** : when possible list all members of a set e.g. $\{ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 \}$ or $\{ a, e, i, o, u\}$
- **Set Builder** : e.g. $\{ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$ may be written in set builder notation as $\{ x \mid x \text{ is an odd positive integer less than 10} \}$ or $\{ x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \mid x \text{ is odd and } x < 10 \}$
