# Logic and Proofs

- Propositions: A proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both.

Examples: 

- 1 + 1 = 2
- 2 + 2 = 3
* Karachi is the capital of Pakistan
- Quetta is the capital city of Balochistan

Examples that are not propositions:
- What time is it?
- Rise early in the morning
- x + 2 = 3
- x + y = z

- Letters are used to denote propositional variables.
- Conventional letters used for propositional variables are p, q, r, s, ...
- Truth value of a true proposition is true and is denoted by T
- Truth value of a false proposition is false and is denoted by F
- The area of logic that deals with propositions is called propositional calculus or propositional logic
- Many mathematical statements are constructed by combining one or more propositions called compound propositions
- compound propositions are formed using logical operators

- Negations: Let p be a proposition. The negation of p, denoted by $\neg p$ 
- The truth value of the negation of p, is the opposite of the truth value of p

Example: Find the negation of the proposition "My PC runs Linux" and express in simple English.

Solution: My PC does not run Linux

Example: Find the negation of the proposition "My smartphone has at least 32GB of memory" and express in simple English.

Solution: My smartphone does not have at least 32GB of memory or My smartphone has less than 32GB of memory
