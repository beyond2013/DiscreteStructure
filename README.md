**Course Name: Discrete Structure**  
**Credit Hours: 3 (3-0)**  
**Contact Hours: 3-0**  
**Pre-requisites: None**  

**Course Introduction:**

Introduces the foundations of discrete mathematics as they apply to Computer Science, focusing on providing a solid theoretical foundation for further work. Further, this course aims to develop understanding and appreciation of the finite nature inherent in most Computer Science problems and structures through study of combinatorial reasoning, abstract algebra, iterative procedures, predicate
calculus, tree and graph structures. In this course more emphasis shall be given to statistical and probabilistic formulation with respect to computing aspects.
